Here you can find problems which we have covered in our classes and homeworks that have been given to us during the semester. The lector gave us two big projects to work on and I have uploaded the first one but the second is in development. The course has a goal to teach us the SOLID princple, encapsulation, inheritance and other OOP C++ topics.

Here is what we covered in this course:
- classes
- encapsulation
- big four
- operators
- inheritence
- polymorphisum
- diamond problem
- working with files
